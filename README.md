# BlogSite

This is a RESTful blog app made using Node.js on Expressjs on the backend. The templating engine for this app is EJS. This was made on MongoDB using Mongoose.
All CRUD methods are using RESTful methods. This app is open for pull requests and modifications. In order to view it, make sure you have MongoDB installed on your computer.

From the command line type in  ```mongod``` and keep the Mongo server running
Open another terminal and ```cd``` into the directory. Right after, type in ```node app.js``` into the command line to start the server.
On your browser, open ```http://localhost:3000/``` to see the BlogApp running. Please note contents on the Blog will differ from user to user due to difference in data.
For convenience's sake I haven't added any prepackaged data to show in the BlogSite so feel free to add your own. Contents in the blog can be freely viewed, edited and deleted. In the near future, i will be adding an authentication system for users to log in and a commenting system.
